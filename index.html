                    Honestly, every time I ask anyone about this movie, I normally get a <br> head scratch as a respone. 
                    Brimming with unexpected talent and <br> full of moments that have become a part of our culture, Freaks is <br>
                    a must view for anyone who likes a good revenge tale.

                <div class="firstcolumnn">
                    <p>Mainly centered on the story of Hans, played beautifully by <br>
                    Harry Earles, and his love and eventual marriage to the beautiful<br>
                    Cleopatra(played by Olga Baclanova). Unknowkn to Hans, Cleopatra <br>
                    only has eyes for Hans's inheritance and she teams up with Hercules <br>
                    (played by Henry Victor) the strongman to get their grubby mitts on <br>
                     his money.
